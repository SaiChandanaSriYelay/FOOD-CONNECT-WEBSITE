# FOOD-CONNECT-WEBSITE
Food Connect is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js,  Node.js,Html,Css,Javascript) that bridges the gap between food donors and food takers. The platform enables users to donate surplus food and helps those in need find available food nearby, thus promoting zero food waste and social responsibility.
