# FOOD-CONNECT-WEBSITE
Food Connect is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js,  Node.js,Html,Css,Javascript) that bridges the gap between food donors and food takers. The platform enables users to donate surplus food and helps those in need find available food nearby, thus promoting zero food waste and social responsibility.

 Food Management — Donors can add, update, and delete food listings with details like name, description, location, and quantity.

 Request System — Takers can view available foods and place requests for collection.

 Protected Routes — Access control using JWT to ensure authorized operations only.

 Interactive Frontend — Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React), with an engaging and modern UI.

 Backend APIs — RESTful APIs built with Express.js and MongoDB to handle food, user, and request data.
